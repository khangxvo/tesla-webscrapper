The main ways in which the simulation team realizes this is through building tools that enable Autopilot Software Developers to perform virtual test drives instead of real ones, testing all Autopilot software releases for regressive behavior and generating synthetic data sets for neural network training.     The foundation on which we build these elements is our simulation environment. We develop photorealistic worlds for our virtual car to drive in, enabling our developers to iterate faster and rely less on real-world testing. We strive for perfect correlation to real-world vehicle behavior and work with Autopilot Software Engineers to improve both Autopilot and the simulator over time. Our group is a cross-disciplinary team with people from various backgrounds and fields of expertise, like CS generalists, mechanical engineers, game developers, and computer graphics artists. As a member on this team, you will be challenged to learn about all these different disciplines and use your own expertise to further improve the scope and usability of our tools.
